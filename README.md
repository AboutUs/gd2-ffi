gd2-ffi
=======

gd2-ffi is ruby bindings for gd2, implemented with [FFI][FFI]

  [FFI]: http://kenai.com
  
The bindings are currently very incomplete, only including what I need for a certain project (Creating truecolor images, drawing rectangles, drawing TrueType fonts). 

It follows the same API as the [gd2 gem][GD2-GEM]

  [GD2-GEM]: http://gd2.rubyforge.org/

The reason for building this gem is that the other gd2 gem had problems with segfaulting on some linux boxes, and it was more fun and quicker to learn FFI than debug dlopen (Which I have no idea how it works) :)Â¨
